## Front-end part
### Introduction
It is using the Material-UI for building the front-end theme.

Reference :

https://material-ui.com/

### How to run
- Firstly, make sure you have installed the `nodejs` and `npm` (it is better if using `yarn`)
- Move to **Frontend** folder : `cd Frontend`
- Run `npm install`(or `npm update` if it is not the first time) to install the libraries which are based on **package.json**
- After installation finish, run `npm start` to start the front-end
- If there is no any errors, it will show something as below. 

As you see, if you want to create a production build, please use `yarn`.
Now, you can access the front-end as http://localhost:3000
```
